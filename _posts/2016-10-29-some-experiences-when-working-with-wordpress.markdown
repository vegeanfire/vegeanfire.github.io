About 2 years working with WordPress, i faced some small to big problems with WordPress.
Today i will share you all about them.

1. Cannot upload big files:
You have to see the config in php.ini file: post_max, max_upload * size
Check again permission on the upload folder, grant "write" access.

2. Cannot display image files
